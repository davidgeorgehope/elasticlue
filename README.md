1 Add opentelemetry instrumentation

2 Make it a little bit hard, make it so you have to question the suspects and they will also give you clues, in addtion to the ones you find. 

3 Make it so you need to find all the clues to make full sense of who the murderer is. 

4 Add bugs and performance issues to fix. Make it so you can't complete the game unless you fix the bugs.
